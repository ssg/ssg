### .init
Hi, I'm Sedat Kapanoglu. I've been writing programs since I was 9 years old. Some 
of my professional background is listed on my LinkedIn [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kapanoglu/).

### .code
I use GitHub mostly as a sandbox to play as well as an archive for my old projects 
but I have a couple of hobby open source projects that are slightly more popular:
 - [SimpleBase](https://github.com/ssg/SimpleBase): BaseXxx encoder/decoder library for .NET
 - [HashDepot](https://github.com/ssg/HashDepot): Implementation of unconventional hash functions for .NET
 - [TurkishId](https://github.com/ssg/TurkishId): Turkish citizenship ID number validator for .NET

### .text
I'm writing a book called [Street Coder](https://www.manning.com/books/street-coder) for beginner/medium-level programmers. I blog about mostly programming on Medium with the handle [@ssg](https://medium.com/@ssg). My Twitter is [@esesci](https://twitter.com/esesci). I also answer questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/54937/sedat-kapanoglu?tab=profile) and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sedat-Kapanoglu).
