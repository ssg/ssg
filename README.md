### .init
Hi, I'm Sedat! I've been writing programs since I was 9 years old. I'm a self-taught programmer who later worked at Microsoft Windows Core OS Division as a Software Engineer. My LinkedIn [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kapanoglu/) has more details.

### .text
- ðŸ“™I've written [Street Coder](https://streetcoder.org), a book that teaches unconventional perspectives to beginner/mid-level programmers. 
- I blog mostly about programming at [ssg.dev](https://ssg.dev).

### .code
I use GitHub mostly as a sandbox to play as well as an archive for my old projects, 
but I have a couple of hobby open source projects that are slightly more popular:
 - [SimpleBase](https://github.com/ssg/SimpleBase): BaseXxx encoder/decoder library for .NET. It's used in projects like Net-dns and Ipfs.Core. 
 - [HashDepot](https://github.com/ssg/HashDepot): Implementation of unconventional hash functions for .NET. It's used in Unity3D DOTS and Apache Pulsar.
 - [TurkishId](https://github.com/ssg/TurkishId): Turkish citizenship ID number validator for .NET.

### .hist
I started writing programs on a borrowed [Sinclair ZX Spectrum+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum+). My parents later bought me an [Amstrad CPC464](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464) on which I taught myself BASIC and Z80 Assembly. I switched to PC by working on a [IBM PS/2 Model 30 286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2_Model_30) secretly in the computing department of Anadolu University while still studying high school. I learned Turbo Pascal and OOP during that time. I failed university entrance exams, and started working professionally at a software company immediatey after my high school graduation.

- I developed many shareware and commercial applications in the 90's. In fact, PC World Magazine in Turkey released a Floppy Disk called "Alaturka '96 - Top 10 Turkish Shareware" in 1996, and [six of the software included were written by me](https://twitter.com/esesci/status/1137479395650596864).
- I won 1st place award in Altin Disket (Golden Floppy Disk) '94 competition organized by Microsoft and PC World Magazine with my file manager called "Baston" that [resembled Windows Explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241217/159136746-e05f6e95-eaca-4dc3-9dcd-ddd7aa2a0478.png) before it was a thing.
- I got 3rd place among 38 teams by myself in Middle East Technical University Programming Contest in the 90's. I was studying Economics at the time, so that was the only time an Economics student got a high ranking in such a contest.
- I wrote one of the earliest e-commerce applications in Turkey called CyberShop in 1995 for BBS systems that allowed SysOps to sell merchandise and users to sell their own stuff.
- I have so many failed projects that one of my talks that I recount my failures takes more than an hour. A partial Turkish transcript can be found [here](https://blog.etohum.com/p/eksisozlukun-kurulus-hikayesini-biliyor-musunuz).
- I also wrote one of the earliest incantations of a "Facebook-like" service in the 90's called "HiTBase" that let you find other people based on criteria you gave to connect with them.
- My friends and I formed a demogroup called [Arteffect](http://arteffect.org) in 1997. We released a musicdisk called [Heretical](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=11649), and a couple other small stuff.
- I wrote one of the earliest e-commerce applications that used AJAX (it wasn't even named at the time) by utilizing [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) to show dynamic content orchestrated with the server in 2000 or so.
- I wrote multiplayer door games for BBS systems called "Yogurt" and "Bitmeyen SavaÅŸ" ("Neverending War").
- I once wrote code on a [Data General Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General_Nova) mainframe using only physical latches to set bits and advance memory registers for a CAT scanner residing in a warehouse in Giresun, TÃ¼rkiye.
- I started writing my own operating system in the 90's but quickly gave up after finishing the [bootloader](https://gist.github.com/ssg/546634). 
- I developed one of the earliest instances of a social platform called [EkÅŸi SÃ¶zlÃ¼k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek%C5%9Fi_S%C3%B6zl%C3%BCk) in 1999. It has since been one of the most popular web sites visited in Turkey, and the most popular Turkish social platform to date. It's been getting 30+M of unique visitors every month and has been seen as "[the bastion of free speech in Turkey](https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c201enw6)."
- I wrote [an infinite maze generator in 12 bytes](https://github.com/ssg/mazecpc) on an Amstrad CPC464 as a homage to both the machine itself and the book "[10 PRINT CHR$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10](https://10print.org/)".
- I won a 128-byte intro competition at one of 7DX demoscene parties because I was the only entrant for that category :).
- I love watching anime. I was so inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion that I wrote a network monitoring tool called [Melchior](https://github.com/ssg/melchior) that was [inspired by the looks of the series](https://twitter.com/esesci/status/1186757891195170816).
- I designed and developed a fault-tolerant, realtime-compressing data transfer protocol for Turkish Directorate of Meteorology in 1995 because the rural stations at the time had flaky connections.
- Because my friends and I didn't have money to license Shockwave Multi User Server, I reverse engineered the protocol and wrote my own SMUS called FUBS (Ftuffball Server, named after my friend Detay's game project). Some of its pieces can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ssg/546569).
- I started writing many different flavors of Nortom Commander clones on both DOS and Windows: Coke Commander, [Pitikare Commander](https://github.com/ssg/pitikare), [SoC](https://twitter.com/esesci/status/1220640912444809218), and definitely more. I usually set out to employ interesting paradigms, like parallel processing and whatnot but got bored quickly. The sources for SoC are [here](https://github.com/ssg/soc).
- Despite the existence of many popular variants, I wrote my own Matrix screensaver when the first batch of sequels came out in 2003. It was quite popular in Turkey, so I [open sourced](https://github.com/ssg/ssgmatrix) it. 
- I appear in the books [The Routledge Companion to Global Internet Histories](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Companion-to-Global-Internet-Histories/Goggin-McLelland/p/book/9780367870751), [Made With](https://books.google.com/books/about/Made_With.html?id=xW0NAgAAQBAJ) by John Grant, and [Twitter and Tear Gas](https://www.twitterandteargas.org/) by Zeynep Tufekci.
- My book [Street Coder](https://streetcoder.org) got translated to [Korean](https://twitter.com/esesci/status/1699981242526224434), [Russian](https://twitter.com/esesci/status/1755043238602576002), [Chinese](https://x.com/esesci/status/1828904674428366849), and [Turkish](https://www.canyayinlari.com/sokak-kodcusu-9786256377981)!
